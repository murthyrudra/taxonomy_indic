      In physics, magnetism is the process in which an object exerts attraction or repulsion force on another object. Objects which exhibit this property are called magnets. Nickel, iron, cobalt and their alloys have easily recognizable magnetic properties. It is known that all objects are affected by the presence of magnetic field to a greater or lesser extent.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How does the magnetic property of nickel compare to that of iron? (Provide the answer in bulleted points.)
        answer: |
          - Both nickel and iron are magnetic materials.
          - Nickel and iron are used in similar applications due to their magnetic properties.
          - Nickel has slightly different magnetic properties compared to iron, particularly in terms of coercivity and saturation magnetization.
      - question: |
          How does the effect of a magnetic field on ferromagnetic materials compare to non-ferromagnetic materials? (Provide the answer in bulleted points.)
        answer: |
          - Ferromagnetic materials (like iron and cobalt) experience a stronger magnetic attraction.
          - Non-ferromagnetic materials experience a weaker or no magnetic attraction.
          - Ferromagnetic materials can become magnets themselves, while non-ferromagnetic materials cannot.
      - question: |
          How do magnetic fields affect objects of different magnetic susceptibilities? (Provide the answer in bulleted points.)
        answer: |
          - Objects with high magnetic susceptibility experience a stronger force in a magnetic field.
          - Objects with low magnetic susceptibility experience a weaker force or negligible effect.
          - Magnetic susceptibility determines how easily an object can be magnetized or attracted to a magnet.

      Humans have known about iron since ancient times. The use of iron was known to the people of India 300-400 years before Christ. Iron weapons etc. of the archaeological period have been found in Tinneveli district of Tamil Nadu state, Brahmagiri of Karnataka and Takshashila, which are known to be from about 400 years before Christ. People were skilled in the iron industry even 1,500 years ago in Kapilavastu, Buddhgaya etc., because many signs of iron metallurgy are still found in these places. The huge iron pillar in front of Qutub Minar of Delhi was built in the fourth century during the period of King Chandravarman of Pushkarna, Rajasthan. It is a vivid example of India's excellent metalcraft. The length of this pillar is 24 feet and its estimated weight is more than 6 tons. Analysis of its iron has revealed that it contains 99.72 percent iron. The metallurgy of the fourth century can be estimated from the fact that this pillar has been standing unaffected by wind and rain for 15 centuries. The surprising thing is how such a long and wide pillar was made, because even today it is a difficult task to make such a huge pillar.

      Blood or hem is a body fluid that continuously flows in various organs through blood vessels. This thick, somewhat sticky, red coloured fluid flowing in blood vessels is a living tissue. It is made up of plasma and blood cells. Plasma is the lifeless liquid medium in which blood cells float. These cells are able to reach the entire body with the help of plasma and it is the plasma that carries the nutrients absorbed from the intestines to various parts of the body and takes the harmful substances formed after the digestive process to the excretory organs and gives them a chance to be cleaned. There are three types of blood cells, red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. Red blood cells carry oxygen from the respiratory organs to the entire body and carry carbon dioxide from the body to the respiratory organs. Their deficiency causes anemia. White blood cells protect the body from harmful substances and disease-causing germs. Platelets help protect blood vessels and form blood.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How do the functions of red blood cells compare to those of white blood cells? (Provide the answer in bulleted points.)
        answer: |
          - Red blood cells carry oxygen from the respiratory organs to the entire body and transport carbon dioxide back to the lungs.
          - White blood cells protect the body from harmful substances and disease-causing germs.
          - Red blood cells are primarily involved in oxygen transport, while white blood cells are involved in immune response.
      - question: |
          How does the role of platelets in blood compare to that of red blood cells? (Provide the answer in bulleted points.)
        answer: |
          - Platelets are involved in blood clotting and protecting blood vessels.
          - Red blood cells are responsible for transporting oxygen and carbon dioxide.
          - Platelets work primarily in wound repair and preventing excessive bleeding, while red blood cells focus on respiratory gas transport.
      - question: |
          How do the different types of blood cells contribute to overall blood function? (Provide the answer in bulleted points.)
        answer: |
          - Red blood cells carry oxygen to tissues and remove carbon dioxide.
          - White blood cells fight infections and protect against disease.
          - Platelets help in clotting and protecting blood vessels from damage.

      Every atom is made up of a nucleus and the nucleus is bounded by one or more electrons. The nucleus is usually made up of one or more neutrons and an equal number of protons. Protons and neutrons are called nucleons. More than 99.94% of the mass of an atom is in the nucleus. Protons have a positive electric charge, electrons have a negative electric charge and neutrons have no electric charge. The electrons of an atom are attracted to the protons in the nucleus of an atom by this electromagnetic force. The protons and neutrons in the nucleus are attracted to each other by a different force, i.e. the nuclear force, which is usually stronger than the electromagnetic force repelling the positively charged protons from each other. At the center of the atom is the nucleus which has a very high density. The diameter of the nucleus is measured in Fermi. (One Fermi equals 10^15 i.e. 10 to the power of -15) Negatively charged electrons keep revolving around the nucleus which is called electron cube (electron cloud). The nucleus is made up of positively charged protons and uncharged (neutral) neutrons. When the number of electrons in an atom is equal to the number of protons in its nucleus, then the atom is electrically uncharged; otherwise the atom is in the form of positively charged or negatively charged ions.
